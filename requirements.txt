To set up your Django project in a new environment, you will need to create a requirements.txt file that lists all the necessary libraries along with their versions. This ensures that anyone who wants to run your project can easily install the correct dependencies. Below are the steps to create a virtual environment, install Django and other libraries, and generate the requirements.txt file.
Step-by-Step Installation Guide

1. Create a Virtual Environment
Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your project directory. Then, run the following command to create a virtual environment:
bash
python -m venv venv

This creates a new directory named venv that contains the Python executable and a copy of the pip library.

2. Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment using the following command:
On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate

On macOS/Linux:
bash
source venv/bin/activate

Once activated, your terminal prompt will change to indicate that you are now working within the virtual environment.

3. Install Django and Other Libraries
Install Django and any other required libraries using pip. Based on your provided code, you may need the following libraries:
bash
pip install django==5.1.1 djangorestframework==3.14.0 psycopg2-binary==2.9.5 channels==4.0.0 djongo==1.3.6 Pillow==9.4.0

text
Django==5.1.1
djangorestframework==3.14.0
psycopg2-binary==2.9.5
channels==4.0.0
djongo==1.3.6
Pillow==9.4.0

4. Running Your Project on Another System
To run your project on another system, follow these steps:
Clone or copy your project files to the new system.
Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
Create and activate a new virtual environment as described in steps 1 and 2.
Install dependencies using the requirements.txt file with the following command:
pip install django==5.1.1 djangorestframework==3.14.0 psycopg2-binary==2.9.5 channels==4.0.0 djongo==1.3.6 Pillow==9.4.0
Run migrations to set up your database:
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate

Start the development server:

python manage.py runserver

Now, your Django project should be up and running on another system with all necessary dependencies installed.
Additional Notes
Make sure that PostgreSQL is installed and configured correctly on the new system since your project uses it as a database.
Update any necessary configurations in settings.py, such as database credentials, before running migrations.
If you are using any static files or media files, ensure they are also transferred to the new environment accordingly.
By following these instructions, you can easily set up your Django application in any environment with consistent results.
